Q1: Read through the functions and docstrings (triple-quote text below
   the function definition).  
    * How many functions are there? What is each function's purpose?
A1: Functions: 5 functions:
test_greet: Because the preclass assignment functions are imported, the test_greet function checks that the function "greet" from our preclass assignment actually returns the expected string. 

The same is the case for the other functions, they are made to see if the functions in the preclass assignment return the expected outcome. 

Q2:Read through the `test_square_list()` function. Do you understand
   how it works?  

A2: In the function "test_square_list" an input and the expected output is given. The function then tests, if the preeclass_assignment function named "square_list" is given the input, is the actual output equal to the expected output defined. 

After adapting test_fibbonaci_stop and running pytest again, 4 test fails, and 1 is passing.
