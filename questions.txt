5: What is a branch and why would I use one?  

A branch is a separate workspace, where changes can be made outside of the main "project". Then it can be merged into the main project or main branch afterwards.
It is both good because it is safer to test new code outside of the main branch, and because it can be better for collaboration, if each person writes in their own branch and merges later. 

6: How could you visualize a branch with 3 commits, and then another branch that breaks off after the second commit and has a single commit?

o---o---o  (main branch)
     \
      o  (feature branch)

The o's are commits. The first lines represent af timeline with commits, where another branch breaks off after the second commit. 

7: Give an example of a set of git commands that would result in a merge conflict.  

A merge conflict could happen if two people/branches are modifying the same part of a file, but in different ways. When they both push, a merge conflict will happen. 

8: Is Git suitable for latex documents?
